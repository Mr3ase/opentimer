# Open Timer
## What is Open Timer ?
Open Timer is a powerful, open-source, intuitive, user-friendly web interface for time logging. It allows its user, once set up, to log their daily tasks on a per week basis.

## Who is this for ?
Open Timer's first aimed at businesses who wish to track their employees schedule efficiently. With Open Timer, your employees can log their daily work task by task and see themselves progress through their week.
Moreover, as a supervisor, you can have a look at the current weekly progress in a glance, validate or invalidate an employee's week sheet, leave a comment...
Open Timer is the ideal companion for your 1-to-1 meetings, with an easy, uninvasive, intuitive interface.
With Open Timer, you will enhance your productivity, only investing human resources where needed. Numbers talk, guaranteed ! 

## Why Open Timer ?
Because every time logging interface as of today is either costing a lot or inspired by some odd Windows 95 theme. Open Timer aims at being up-to-date, cross-platform, easy-to-install, and complying to 2015's standards.

## What do I need ?
All you need is a web server running PHP 5.4 or greater, and a database. Yep, that's all.
